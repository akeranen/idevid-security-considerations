Operational Considerations for Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority
             draft-richardson-anima-masa-considerations-00

Abstract

   This document describes a number of operational modes that a BRSKI
   Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA) may take on.

   Each mode is defined, and then each mode is given a relevance within
   an over applicability of what kind of organization the MASA is
   deployed into.  This document does not change any protocol
   mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] introduces a mechanism for
   new devices (called pledges) to be onboarded into a network without
   intervention from an expert operator.

   This mechanism leverages the pre-existing relationship between a
   device and the manufacturer that built the device.  There are two
   aspects to this relationship: the provision of an identity for the
   device by the manufacturer (the IDevID), and a mechanism which
   convinces the device to trust the new owner (the [RFC8366] voucher).

   The manufacturer, or their designate, is involved in both aspects of
   this process.  This requires the manufacturer to operate a
   significant process for each aspect.

   This document offers a number of operational considerations for each
   aspect.

   The first aspect is the device identity in the form of an
   [ieee802-1AR] certificate that is installed at manufacturing time in
   the device.  The first section of this document deals with
   operational considerations of building this public key
   infrastructure.

   The second aspect is the use of the Manufacturer Authorized Signing
   Authority (MASA), as described in

Internet-Draft             MASA Considerations             December 2019


   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] section 2.5.4.  The device
   needs to have the MASA anchor built in; the exact nature of the
   anchor is subject to a many possibilities.  The second section of
   this document deals with a number of options for architecting the
   security of the MASA relationship.

   There are some additional considerations for a MASA that deals with
   constrained vouchers as described in
   [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher].  In particular in the COSE
   signed version, there are no PKI structure included in the voucher
   mechanism, so cryptographic hygiene needs a different set of
   tradeoffs.

2.  Operational Considerations for Manufacturer IDevID Public Key
    Infrastructure

   The manufacturer has the responsability to provision a keypair into
   each device as part of the manufacturing process.  There are a
   variety of mechanisms to accomplish this
